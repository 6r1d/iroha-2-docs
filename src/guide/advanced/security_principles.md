To make working with Iroha installations secure, efforts from both an organization and the individual users are necessary. In this article, we explain these principles.

### Individual

Use strong and unique passwords for all your accounts. Never reuse passwords.

Turn on two-factor authentication (2FA) for all your accounts where possible. 2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring not only a password, but another factor such as a one-time code, fingerprint, or app authentication.

Be careful when opening email attachments or clicking on suspicious links. This could be a phishing or malware attempt. Verify the sender and make sure the links are safe before clicking on them.

Be careful when talking to strangers or providing confidential information over the phone or online. Make sure you are contacting genuine and verified individuals or organizations.

### Common

Use virtual private networks (VPNs) when dealing with sensitive data or accessing sensitive resources over public networks. A VPN creates an encrypted connection, keeping your data confidential and secure.

Protect your network at home or in the office with a firewall. The firewalls help prevent unauthorized access to your network and protect your devices from malware.

Make regular backups of your data so that you can restore it if problems occur or information is lost. Keep backups in a safe place, separate from the primary data storage.

### Organisation

Train employees on data and operational security measures. Consciousness and personnel training are essential aspects of ensuring the organisation's security.

Limit physical access to servers and infrastructure. Establish access controls so authorised people can physically access servers and other equipment.

Implement a security monitoring system that monitors activity and detects potential security breaches. Such a system will help detect and respond to suspicious activity on time.

Conduct regular security audits. Assess the vulnerabilities and verify that the security measures in place are in line with current standards and regulations.

Develop clear security policies and procedures for all employees who handle sensitive data. Train employees to follow these policies and procedures to reduce the risk of reckless actions.

Use an access control system. Grant access rights only to those employees who need these rights to complete their tasks. Such a system will help limit potential threats to the users.

Remember that security is an ongoing process. The organisation must continuously assess its security measures and improve them to meet new threats and challenges.
